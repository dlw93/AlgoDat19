# Algorithms und Data Structures

## Overview

I created these slides for the tutorial on *Algorithms and Data Structures*, accompanying the lecture given by [Prof. Dr. Ulf Leser](https://www2.informatik.hu-berlin.de/~leser) at [Humboldt University of Berlin](https://www.hu-berlin.de) during the summer term of 2019.

The slides are written in German as that was/is a common practice for this tutorial, although I'm considering to translate them to English in the near future (feel free to help me and send a PR).

Also, feel free use this project as a base for your own slides, be it a tutorial, exercise, or lecture.

## Disclaimer

My aim was to develop a set of slides that does *not* look like your typical LaTeX slides.
That's why I used XeTeX, which always compiled just fine on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com).
Nevertheless, I never got this project to compile locally using XeLaTeX, be it oin Windows or UNIX(-like).
Feel free to fix these bugs (they seem to be mostly font-related) and send a PR so I know how you did it :)

After all, I'd love to see this project to deveop into a feature-complete tutorial (so far, there are some gaps, particularly regarding examples), that is accessible to everyone struggling with a certain algorithm, data structure or proof technique â€” as we all do sometimes ;)
