# Algorithms und Data Structures

I created these slides for the tutorial on *Algorithms and Data Structures*, accompanying the lecture given by [Prof. Dr. Ulf Leser](https://www2.informatik.hu-berlin.de/~leser) at [Humboldt University of Berlin](https://www.hu-berlin.de) during the summer term of 2019.

The slides are written in German as that was/is a common practice for this tutorial, although I'm considering to translate them to English in the near future (feel free to help me and send a PR).

I'd love to see this project to develop into a feature-complete tutorial (so far, there are some gaps, particularly regarding examples), that is accessible to everyone struggling with a certain algorithm, data structure or proof technique â€” as we all do sometimes ;)
